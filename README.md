## Intro ✨
An Online Text Tableau based Poker Crypto Platform. Sui. HTML5 / Rust / Heroku. 

Eventually we would like to develop an open source downloadable client. 

We believe Holdem poker could be solved with the data available on the Internet.
Initially this will only be play money. 
The crypto element will be "funding" to pay certain contributors/devs as well as develop a MLL model to SOLVE 100b holdem poker. 
Pot Limit Omaha headsup is BAU, however development will take place in Texas Hold'em for simplicity. 

## Problem ✨
We are a poker community fed up with the lack of EXCELLENT software for us to play poker on. 
We want to play 1 million hands of poker a month online. 

Advanced developers / please support us with your time on this journey especially if you ever played on Full Tilt between 2003-2008. This is what we would like to build from an customer experience perspective, the RNG is the most important feature. We believe Holdem poker could be solved with the data available on the Internet. 

## Solution ✨
A HTML5 Text based Poker Platform. Possibly built with RUST and a backend of Heroku, open for discussion. Please log an issue to discuss with us. 

## Features ✨
Each player will be dealt a list of 40 hands to grind, 5 second decisions need to be made by HERO. (Holdem will be used as an example but the site will operate PLO Headsup, 2 player poker). 
4 color deck. (Ah = red) (Ac = green) (As = Black) (Ad = Blue)

See spreadsheet, please complete spreadsheet.
